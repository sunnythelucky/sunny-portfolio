			"Sunhui and I worked together on several projects, and I was lucky to call her my coworker. She consistently gave 100 percent effort to the team and played a significant role in ensuring that we completed assignments on time. She had excellent time management skills and had a knack for keeping everyone calm and productive during intense crunch periods. She is a talented front-end developer with great experience in AWS .Any team would be lucky to have Sunhui. ",

			"Sunhui is a very passionate and loves what she does. Seeing her motivated while we were working together also encouraged me to be like her. In my view, for her work means more than how others usually think about it. I am glad to have an opportunity to work with her. Hope she works on even more fantastic projects with future co-workers!",
